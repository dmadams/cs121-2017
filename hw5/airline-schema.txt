I combined the flight number and flight_date of flights and seat number of seats
together as flight_seats. This schema will keep track of the seat numbers
available on each individual flight, information that is extremely useful and
likely to be referenced very often.

Also, I split the phone numbers for customers into a seperate schema to make 
them simpler to handle.
