-- [Problem 18]
The second step takes so long because the database is scanning through all of
the rows in t2 as well to ensure that no rows in t2 have an a value
corresponding to the a value of the row just deleted from t1 due to the
foreign key. This behavior will be repeated for every row that is deleted from
t1 by the SQL statement. 

Since the developer already removed the rows from t2 in the first step, he can
simply remove the foreign key then execute his SQL statement then redo the
foreign key.

ALTER TABLE t2 DROP FOREIGN KEY (a);
DELETE FROM t1 WHERE a IN (list of values to remove);
ALTER TABLE t2 ADD FOREIGN KEY (a) REFERENCES t1(a);
